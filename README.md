## Abstract
Scheduling jobs on multiple machines in some applications like fabric dying is an NP hard problem where the goal is to find jobs sequence from combinatorial search space to process on each machine such that it optimizes multiple objectives liketotal time taken to finish the  processing  of  all  jobs, minimizingthe  overall  shade difference,and  minimizing  the overall setup time.There are certain constraints that need to be followed to ensure that each job is processed only on one machine. In this research project, we proposed the approach based  on  genetic  algorithm  to  perform multi-objective combinatorial  optimizations for fabric dying scheduling application.
